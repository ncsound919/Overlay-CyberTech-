      "elevator_pitch": "Cheetah GovTech Security Platform is the only cybersecurity solution purpose-built for government and education institutions, providing automated compliance with FERPA, CMMC, and NIST 800-171, AI-powered threat detection, and blockchain-based audit logs. We enable K-12 schools, universities, and defense contractors to achieve compliance, prevent breaches, and protect sensitive student and research data.",
      "problem_solved": "Government and education institutions face unique cybersecurity challenges: strict compliance requirements (FERPA, CMMC, NIST 800-171), limited budgets and expertise, increasing ransomware attacks, and complex multi-tenant access control. Generic enterprise security tools lack education/government-specific features and are too expensive or complex. Education-only tools lack advanced threat detection and government-grade security.",
      "solution": "Integrated platform combining compliance automation, advanced threat detection, incident response, and FIPS 140-3 encryption. Pre-built for government and education use cases with student privacy, CMMC assessment, blockchain audit logs, and federal breach reporting. Scalable from small school districts to large research universities and defense contractors.",
      "target_customers": "13,000 K-12 school districts, 200 research universities, 300,000 defense contractors (focus on primes), 160 DoDEA schools. Total addressable market: $8B.",
      "business_model": "Per-student pricing for K-12 ($8-15/student/year), site licenses for universities ($75,000-250,000/year), enterprise licenses for defense contractors ($150,000-500,000/year), government contracts for DoDEA. Additional revenue from managed SOC services, CMMC consulting, training, and compliance-as-a-service.",
